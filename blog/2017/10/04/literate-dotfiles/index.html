<h1>Literate Dotfiles</h1>

<h2 id="org5b99509">Motivation</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org5b99509">
<blockquote>
<p>
Let us change our traditional attitude to the construction of programs: Instead of imagining that our main task is to instruct a computer what to do, let us concentrate rather on explaining to human beings what we want a computer to do.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
In <a href="http://www.literateprogramming.com/knuthweb.pdf">Donald Knuth's 1984 paper "Literate Programming"</a>, he argued that code is not enough. That is to say it is not enough to only tell a computational device how to behave. The cognitive energy of the humans who maintain such code also need to be considered. Such was the conundrum I found myself in while trying to maintain my 'dotfiles' - my user-specific system configuration files for *nix-like hosts. I've struggled to find a balance of organization, readability, and documentation.
</p>

<p>
Early on, I treated these configuration files as write-only repositories of code snippets. As a result, they were difficult to reason about so I didn't try to change them too often. They were 'code' in the deepest sense of the word - I never intended them to read well. As such, the few times a friend or colleague would ask about a particular piece of behavior while pairing, it was almost impossible to discuss with colleagues - the configuration itself was a lousy example.

<h2 id="org0c88f04">A step toward literacy</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org0c88f04">
<p>
What if, with a little reorganization, we could document intent, in a human readable format, and provide executable examples from which our actualy-on-disk dotfiles could be generated?
</p>

<p>
Enter Emacs' Babel package; a sub-system of <a href="http://orgmode.org/">Emacs org-mode</a> which allows us to embed code blocks inside of natural language documents. Exporting the code is great, but what about the reader's experience? Naturally, emacs handles the display of org-mode documents rather well. When working with the dotfiles org-mode document, one has access to all of the normal Emacs and org-mode document editing features: org's easy to use document syntax, section/hader folding, search, etc. But what about our non-emacs friends? Popular git forges like Github and Gitlab have us covered. In addition to markdown, org-mode tends to be supported as a source format for documentation and static HTML generation on popular code hosting platforms. As a result, the woven/human-readable version of the dotfiles render rather well.

<h2 id="org0f5b33d">Making the move</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org0f5b33d">
<p>
Organizing a scattered collection of dotfiles configuration into a literate document and generating/tangling the code examples into usable configuration can be described as follows:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>First, organize and copy each logical group of configuration code the existing dotfiles into org-mode code blocks.</li>
<li>Then add intention revealing documentation for each block.</li>
<li>Next, add metadata about the tangling/export process. These properties tell babel that the code blocks under the <code>.bashrc</code> header should be exported to the file at <code>~/.bashrc</code>.</li>
<li>And finally we need to tangle/export the code by running <code>M-x org-babel-tangle</code> - in my dotfiles repository I include a <a href="https://github.com/indiebrain/.files/blob/71d302e097483dd878e76ff4cf53372bdf184523/install.sh">dotfiles generation and installation script</a> that will automatically tangle/export all of the code blocks.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="orge4c7fcc">Conclusion</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orge4c7fcc">
<p>
I've used this literate approach to generate my <a href="https://github.com/indiebrain/.files/blob/master/configuration.org">personal dot-files</a> and <a href="https://github.com/indiebrain/.emacs.d/blob/1917b9e37f67299a559286df0a95746198243eb0/configuration.org">Emacs configuration</a> for a few months. I find it to be much easier to manage and reason about and maintain confidently. Though I wouldn't recommend Literate Programming for every task, I find that "prose first development" works great for clarifying the scope and intent of a task when modifying system configuration.
